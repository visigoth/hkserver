A suite of utilities for managing HomeKit.

Apple now ships HomeKit APIs via Mac Catalyst. This allows for the creation of utilities that manage HomeKit scenes, automation, and devices outside of Apple's Home MacOS app.

- **HKServer**: A gRPC server for HomeKit APIs written in swift and buildable with Xcode
- **hkserver-rs**: An experimental implementation of `HKServer` in rust
